This project focused on identifying traffic signs using machine learning techniques. The notebook begins by importing and exploring a dataset containing images of traffic signs, which are then preprocessed through resizing and normalization. It employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to train a model for image classification, leveraging data augmentation to improve generalization. The notebook includes steps for splitting the dataset into training and validation sets, defining and training the CNN architecture, and evaluating model performance using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices. The project demonstrates a structured approach to traffic sign recognition, incorporating best practices in deep learning for computer vision.
